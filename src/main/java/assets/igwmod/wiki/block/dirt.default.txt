[prefix{l}]Dirt Block [prefix{r}]
Dirt is a basic block found abundantly in the Overworld. It is found at any altitude, and comprises the majority of the upper terrain layers in most overworld biomes. 
Dirt can be thought of as a filler block, used during world generation to fill gaps between resources and features and provide shaping material for terrain, but it can also be collected and utilized for building. 
Grass, snow, and mycelium can spread/collect over the top layer of Dirt blocks; mining these will drop ordinary Dirt blocks. Podzol cannot spread to dirt blocks, because it is a variant of the dirt block itself.
When a dirt block is adjacent to a grass block and is exposed to a light level of at least 4 (e.g. from torches or sunlight), it will eventually be converted into a grass block at random intervals (see grass for growth details). 
Mycelium spreads in similar fashion, but requires a light level of at least 9.
A variant of dirt, grassless dirt, is featured in the Mega Taiga, Mesa and Savanna biome. 
The only difference to regular dirt is that grass cannot spread to it. It can only be obtained with the /give command and has a data value of 1. Once the block is broken, it becomes normal dirt.
